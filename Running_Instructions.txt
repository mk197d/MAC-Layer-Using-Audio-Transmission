1.  We have made 2 different files "Sender_n.py" and "Receiver_n.py" to run the sender and receiver separately.

2.  To start the sender and receiver simulateneously, we have written a run.py script.

3.  For running the run.py script, download "konsole" using sudo apt install konsole.

4.  Put all your messages in the messages.txt file and while running the sender, press enter to send each 
    messages in sequence.

5.  The messages recieved will be appended in "receive.txt" and the messages sent will be appended to "send.txt".

6.  The time parameters for timeout, SIFS, etc. may be need to be adjusted depending on the laptops and 
    testing conditions.
